<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr />
<p>I am a new Web Developer. I also teach elementary school, but am working toward
  web development full time.</p>  

  <p>I am creative with a love for details, efficiency, life-long learning, 
  and hard-work.  I am currently working on projects to help me sharpen my coding skills and 
  to continue learning all I can about web development.</p>

  <p>I am excited to put my skills to work for your company.</p>
